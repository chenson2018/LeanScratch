This repo collects some formalizations of books I am currently reading. Below
are short descriptions of each subdirectory.

## CTIC

This formalizes some results from [Category Theory in
Context](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf). I use Mathlib, but try to do
so in a way that strikes a balance between utilizing existing background lemmas
and working through the proofs myself.
