# LeanScratch

This repo collects some formalizations of books I am currently reading. Below
are short descriptions of each subdirectory.

## CTIC

This formalizes some results from *[Category Theory in
Context](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf)*. I use Mathlib, but try to do
so in a way that strikes a balance between utilizing existing background lemmas
and working through the proofs myself.

# Untyped

This formalizes some results on the untyped lambda calculus, using Barendregt's
*The Lambda Calculus, Its Syntax and Semantics* and Pierce's *Types and
Programming Languages* as references. The goal here is to formalize its
categorical semantics.
