# LeanScratch

This repo collects some formalizations of books I am currently reading. Below
are short descriptions of each subdirectory.

## CTIC

This formalizes some results from *[Category Theory in
Context](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf)*. I use Mathlib, but try to do
so in a way that strikes a balance between utilizing existing background lemmas
and working through the proofs myself.

## Untyped

This formalizes some results on the untyped lambda calculus, using Barendregt's
*The Lambda Calculus, Its Syntax and Semantics*, Pierce's *Types and Programming
Languages*, *[Software
Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/)*, and *[Programming
Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/)* as references. The goal
here is to formalize its categorical semantics.
